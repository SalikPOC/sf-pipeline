# OrbitOps — sf-pipeline

Salesforce CI/CD platform giving citizen developers a DevOps-Center-like experience
on GitHub Actions + Salesforce CLI, with UI-driven rollback, diff visibility,
configurable stage gates, static code analysis, and work-item traceability.
Full spec: `REQUIREMENTS.md` (epics E1–E9). This repo is the SFDX project +
pipeline machinery; the web UI lives in the separate `orbitops-ui` repo.

## Architecture summary

- GitHub is the source of truth; SFDX **source format**, single package dir `force-app`.
- **Branch-per-environment promotion**: `feature/*` → `integration` → `uat` → `main`.
  Every promotion is a PR. Stage config lives in `.orbitops/pipeline.yml`
  (schema: `.orbitops/schema/pipeline.schema.json`).
- **Delta deploys** via sfdx-git-delta; PR validation is check-only deploy
  (`sf project deploy validate`) with quick-deploy on merge when eligible.
- **Deploy history**: tag `deploy/<env>/<seq>` + GitHub Deployment + manifest JSON
  committed to the `orbitops-meta` branch.
- **Rollback** = reverse delta between deploy tags, validate-first, destructive
  changes opt-in, forward revert commit (never force-push).
- **Stage gates** = GitHub Environments (required reviewers) + in-workflow gates
  (minCoverage, scannerMaxSeverity) from pipeline.yml.
- **Work items**: Jira keys (PROJ-123) / ADO refs (AB#456) in branch names, PR
  titles, `Work-Items:` commit footers. PoC = format validation + stub adapter
  only; live Jira/ADO APIs are post-PoC (see E2 PoC-scope note).

## Key design decisions (D1–D9, see REQUIREMENTS.md §4)

D1 branch-per-env promotion · D2 source format, one package dir · D3 JWT org auth,
secrets in GitHub Environments · D4 standalone Next.js UI + GitHub App (runs on
localhost for PoC) · D5 work-item IDs in branch/PR conventions · D6 tracker adapter
interface (stub for PoC) · D7 Salesforce Code Analyzer v5 · D8 rollback is
metadata-only, validate-first with preview · D9 test level per stage
(RunLocalTests for uat/main).

## PoC environment

| Branch | Org key | Backing org | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| integration | INT | scratch `devopsDev1` | test.salesforce.com |
| uat | UAT | scratch `stagingscratch` | test.salesforce.com |
| main | PROD | dev org `DevOpsCenterDevHub` | also the Dev Hub |

## Stack

`sf` CLI v2 (pinned 2.142.7) · sfdx-git-delta 6.45.1 ·
@salesforce/plugin-code-analyzer 5.14.0 · GitHub Actions (reusable workflows) ·
Node ESM scripts with `node --test` units · composite action
`.github/actions/sf-auth` for CLI install + JWT auth.

## Conventions

- Use the `sf` CLI v2 only — never legacy `sfdx` commands. Parse `--json` output.
- Thin YAML, fat scripts: workflow logic lives in `scripts/**` (ESM, unit-tested
  with `node --test`); workflows call the scripts.
- Every workflow uploads a structured `orbitops-summary.json` artifact; the UI
  depends on it.
- Pin GitHub Action versions by commit SHA; pin CLI/plugin versions explicitly.
- Sticky PR comments: update in place via hidden marker, never spam new comments.
- Never force-push. Never bypass branch protection. Bot commits clearly attributed.
- Never commit secrets; `*.key`/`*.pem` are gitignored as a backstop.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions blocks: least privilege per workflow.
- Citizen-facing copy avoids Git jargon ("Promote", not "merge PR").
- Profiles are guardrailed metadata: excluded via `.forceignore`; prefer permission sets.

## Decisions

(append project decisions made during build sessions here)

- 2026-07-14: Jira/ADO live integration cut from PoC scope; keep ID conventions +
  stub adapter (REQUIREMENTS.md E2 PoC-scope note).
- 2026-07-14: UI runs on localhost for the PoC; GitHub App with webhooks disabled,
  polling only.
- 2026-07-14: `force-app` seeded with sample objects (BUP_Clinic__c, BUP_Policies__c)
  retrieved from the original scratch orgs, so the pipeline has real metadata to move.
- 2026-07-14: Repos live under the personal account `SalikPOC` (public, so branch
  protection + required-reviewer environments work on the free plan). No teams on
  personal accounts → PoC role mapping is username-list based (env vars in the UI,
  usernames in CODEOWNERS); swap to team slugs when moving to an org.
- 2026-07-14: Auth is split per stage (amends D3): PROD uses JWT via connected app
  "OrbitOps CI" (deployed, verified). Scratch orgs can't create connected apps
  (Spring '26 restriction) and ECA JWT setup isn't metadata-deployable, so
  integration/uat use `sf org login sfdx-url` with an SF_AUTH_URL environment
  secret, refreshed on scratch-org recreation. sf-auth action supports both.
- 2026-07-14: Secrets exist at two levels: repo-level org-prefixed (INT_/UAT_/PROD_)
  for PR validation jobs, environment-level unprefixed for deploy jobs — because
  environment secrets would trigger required-reviewer approval on every PR
  validation (docs/SETUP.md §5).
- 2026-07-14: Rollback design (Phase 6), learned the hard way:
  (a) pipeline scripts ALWAYS run from the workflow ref (main), never from env-branch
  checkouts — env branches diverge via merged rollback PRs and silently pin old code;
  (b) `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` never deletes files absent from <ref> — `git rm`
  the tree first or deletions vanish from revert commits;
  (c) revert commits land via a merged PR (run-unique branch name) when branch
  protection declines direct push — requires repo setting "Allow GitHub Actions to
  create and approve pull requests" (user enabled);
  (d) no-op rollbacks (nothing to restore or delete) exit cleanly without tag/commit;
  (e) rollback shares the deploy-<env> concurrency group so it can't interleave with
  deploys.
- 2026-07-14: Scanner findings surface as a sticky PR comment table + SARIF to
  GitHub code scanning, NOT inline review comments (deviation from BUILD_PROMPTS
  Phase 3 — diff-position mapping wasn't worth PoC complexity). Gate blocks on
  NEW findings (vs .orbitops/scanner-baseline.json, rule+file ±5 lines) with
  severity ≤ the stage's scannerMaxSeverity. SARIF uploads are skipped when the
  scan produces zero runs (code scanning API rejects empty SARIF).
- 2026-07-15: Phases 7–12 complete; UI feature set final for PoC (board, promote,
  pull-my-changes, rollback UI, gate editor via config PRs, audit + DORA-lite
  tiles, drift snapshots, runbook + citizen guide). Companion UI decisions in
  orbitops-ui/CLAUDE.md.
- 2026-07-15: Retrieve falls back to a wildcard-by-type manifest when the source
  org lacks source tracking (SourceMember unsupported → citizen-safe types with
  `*` members; git diff filters real changes). `--wildcard` forces it — the
  nightly drift snapshot uses that for org-vs-branch truth.
- 2026-07-15: Connect-an-org = OAuth authorization-code + PKCE against the one
  "OrbitOps CI" connected app (consumer key is public; isConsumerSecretOptional).
  `prompt=login` is kept deliberately: silent session reuse connected the *wrong*
  org during testing. My Domain input is a fallback only — the generic
  test/login.salesforce.com endpoints work for most orgs. Tokens are sealed as
  repo secrets (`DEV_*_SF_AUTH_URL`) via libsodium; registry lives in
  connected-orgs.json on orbitops-meta. Requires the GitHub App to hold
  Secrets: write.
- 2026-07-15: Rollback preview publishes a combined safety + validation JSON to
  orbitops-meta/rollback-previews/<runId>.json — the UI polls the run, then
  renders the verdict from that file (job stays green; the JSON carries pass/fail).
- 2026-07-15: Flow visual diff learnings: auto-layout flows (Builder default)
  store locationX/Y = 0 for every element, so the viewer computes a layered BFS
  layout and caps it with a synthetic End card; Tailwind utility classes on SVG
  shapes proved unreliable across build modes (unstyled rect renders black) —
  the diagram uses explicit fill/stroke attributes only.
- 2026-07-15: Connect-an-org v2 = JWT via pre-auth (user's design). Root cause of
  v1 failures: new orgs FORCE refresh-token rotation (Support-locked setting) —
  any stored refresh token dies on first use, so sealed-secret auth can never
  work. v2 stores only {username, instanceHost} in the registry; CI does JWT
  Bearer with the shared OrbitOps CI cert (repo secrets ORBITOPS_JWT_CLIENT_ID +
  ORBITOPS_JWT_KEY). Per-org one-time admin step: OAuth Usage → Install →
  admin-approve + profile. Legacy sfdx-url registry entries still resolve.
  Long-term (user): managed-package connected app → prod install inherits into
  refreshed sandboxes, scratch orgs install post-creation → pure self-service.
  Note: ConnectedApp metadata deploys silently ignore isRefreshTokenRotationEnabled.
- 2026-07-17: Topology fully de-hardcoded — stage branches live ONLY in
  pipeline.yml. deploy.yml/pr-validate.yml trigger broadly (branches-ignore
  feature/**, orbitops-meta, orbitops/**) and `resolve-stage.mjs --optional`
  skips non-stage branches (is_stage/is_last_stage outputs gate all jobs);
  back-promotion pairs derive from config (scripts/context/back-promotion-pairs.mjs);
  back-promote runs on the LAST stage, whatever it's called. Stages are now
  added/removed from the OrbitOps Settings UI via config PRs (orbitops-ui
  TopologyEditor → addStage/removeStage actions; best-effort automates stage
  branch + GitHub Environment creation, remaining admin steps land as a PR
  checklist). New stage branches start from their downstream neighbour.
- 2026-07-17: Reusable-workflow refactor — pipeline logic is now single-source
  on main. `_pr-validate.yml`/`_deploy.yml` are `workflow_call` workflows
  holding ALL jobs; `pr-validate.yml`/`deploy.yml` are thin callers pinning
  `@main` (installed once per stage branch, never edited again). Jobs do a
  dual checkout: workspace = the branch under validation/deploy, `.pipeline/` =
  scripts + config + sf-auth from main (config-only scripts run with
  working-directory .pipeline). Consequence: fixes merged to main apply to
  every stage immediately — no more per-branch workflow syncing. Check runs
  are now named "checks / <job>"; the UI strips the prefix (toCheckChips).
  Rollout order matters: main PR first (creates the `_*.yml`), then the caller
  stubs onto uat/integration. Pro-code path documented in
  docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md — the whole process works from plain Git/GitHub;
  the UI is optional.
- 2026-07-17: Coverage-gate bug fix — a metadata-only change (no Apex) was
  wrongly blocked by "No Apex tests ran, but this stage requires ≥ 75%".
  check-coverage.mjs now takes `--has-apex`; when false, coverage is
  not-applicable and the gate passes. Apex-present-but-no-coverage still fails.
  Gate logic extracted to `evaluateCoverage()` with unit tests. pr-validate.yml
  passes `needs.delta.outputs.has_apex` (same signal that already sets
  NoTestRun in the validate step).
