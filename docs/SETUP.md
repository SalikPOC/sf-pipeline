# OrbitOps Platform Setup (platform owner)

One-time setup for a new pipeline repo. Everything here is clickable/one-liner;
nothing requires local Salesforce tooling except the certificate step.

## 1. Branches

From the repo's default branch (`main`), create the two lower environment branches
at the same commit:

```bash
git branch integration && git branch uat
git push origin main integration uat
```

## 2. Branch protection

For **each** of `main`, `uat`, `integration` (Settings → Branches → Add rule):

- Require a pull request before merging (no direct pushes)
- Require status checks to pass; select the `OrbitOps /*` checks once they exist
- Require conversation resolution
- Do NOT allow force pushes or deletions

## 3. GitHub Environments (stage gates)

Settings → Environments → New environment. Create exactly these names (they must
match `environment:` values in `.orbitops/pipeline.yml`):

| Environment | Required reviewers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `integration` | none | fast lane for citizen devs |
| `uat` | release-managers team | |
| `production` | release-managers team | consider also a wait timer |

Release managers can **approve or reject gated releases from inside the
OrbitOps UI**: the review is made with the signed-in reviewer's own GitHub
identity (user-to-server token), so whoever approves must be listed as a
required reviewer here — no extra reviewer entries needed. (GitHub Apps can't
be required reviewers on personal-account repos, which is why the app itself
isn't in the list.) One prerequisite: the UI's GitHub App needs its
**Deployments** permission set to *Read and write* (see the UI repo's
`docs/GITHUB_APP.md`) and the permission update accepted on the installation.
Approving directly on GitHub keeps working either way.

## 4. Org authentication

Two methods, chosen per stage via the `auth-method` input of the
`.github/actions/sf-auth` composite action:

- **`jwt`** (production/persistent orgs): connected app + certificate, below.
- **`sfdx-url`** (scratch-org stages): orgs created after Salesforce's Spring '26
  change can't create connected apps (External Client Apps' JWT flow still needs
  UI steps, so it isn't scriptable either). Instead, store the CLI's auth URL:
  `sf org display -o <alias> --verbose --json` → `result.sfdxAuthUrl` → secret
  `SF_AUTH_URL` on that stage's environment. Refresh it whenever the scratch org
  is recreated.

### Connected app + JWT certificate (per persistent org)

1. Generate a keypair (or run `scripts/setup/provision-connected-app.mjs` when
   available, which automates steps 1–3):
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 \
     -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj "/CN=orbitops-ci"
   ```
2. Deploy the connected app: the metadata lives at
   `force-app/main/default/connectedApps/` (certificate embedded, consumer key
   pre-set) together with the `OrbitOps_CI` permission set. Deploy both to each org
   and assign the permission set to the integration user.
3. Wait 2–10 minutes (connected app propagation), then test locally:
   ```bash
   sf org login jwt --client-id <consumer-key> --username <user> \
     --jwt-key-file server.key --instance-url <login-url>
   ```
4. **Never commit `server.key`.** `.gitignore` blocks `*.key`/`*.pem` as a backstop.

## 5. Secrets

Secrets exist at **two levels** with the same values:

- **Repository-level, org-key-prefixed** (`INT_SF_AUTH_URL`, `UAT_SF_AUTH_URL`,
  `PROD_SF_CLIENT_ID`, `PROD_SF_JWT_KEY`, `PROD_SF_USERNAME`,
  `PROD_SF_INSTANCE_URL`) — used by **PR validation** jobs. These must NOT be
  environment-scoped: environment secrets would trigger the environment's
  required-reviewer gate on every PR validation.
- **Environment-level, unprefixed** (below) — used by **deploy** jobs, which run
  inside the environment and are gated by its required reviewers.

### Environment-level (per GitHub Environment)

In each Environment (Settings → Environments → <env> → Add secret):

**JWT stages** (e.g. `production`):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `SF_CLIENT_ID` | Connected app consumer key |
| `SF_USERNAME` | Integration user username in that org |
| `SF_JWT_KEY` | Full contents of `server.key` (PEM, including BEGIN/END lines) |
| `SF_INSTANCE_URL` | `https://login.salesforce.com` (prod/dev orgs) or `https://test.salesforce.com` (sandboxes & scratch orgs) |

**sfdx-url stages** (e.g. `integration`, `uat`):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `SF_AUTH_URL` | `sf org display -o <alias> --verbose --json` → `result.sfdxAuthUrl` |

Environment-level (not repo-level) secrets matter: they're only exposed to jobs
that pass that environment's gate.

### Optional secrets

| Secret | Level | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` | repo | Slack/Teams incoming-webhook URL; deploy failures post a message. Absent → silently skipped. |
| `DEV_*_SF_AUTH_URL` | repo | Created automatically by the UI's "Connect an org" flow (§7). |

## 6. Org ↔ stage mapping

`.orbitops/pipeline.yml` maps branches to logical org keys and environments.
Current PoC mapping:

| Branch | Org key | Backing org | Login URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `integration` | INT | scratch org (alias `devopsDev1`) | test.salesforce.com |
| `uat` | UAT | scratch org (alias `stagingscratch`) | test.salesforce.com |
| `main` | PROD | Developer org (alias `DevOpsCenterDevHub`) | login.salesforce.com |

> Scratch orgs expire. When recreating (`sf org create scratch -f
> config/scratch-def-int.json -a devopsDev1 -v DevOpsCenterDevHub
> --duration-days 30`), redeploy the connected app and update `SF_USERNAME` in the
> matching environment.

## 7. Registering dev orgs ("Pull my changes" sources)

Builders can pull changes from any sandbox, scratch org, or dev org. There are
two ways to register one:

### Self-service: "Connect an org" in the UI (preferred)

Settings → **Connect an org** in the OrbitOps UI. The builder signs in on
Salesforce's own login page (OAuth authorization-code + PKCE against the
`OrbitOps CI` connected app). The UI stores **no tokens at all** — it records
only the username and instance host in `connected-orgs.json` on the
`orbitops-meta` branch. CI then authenticates to the org via the **JWT Bearer
flow** with the shared OrbitOps CI certificate, acting as that username.
(Why not stored refresh tokens: Salesforce force-rotates them in all new orgs,
so a sealed token dies on first use. JWT mints access tokens on demand — there
is nothing to expire, rotate, or refresh.)

**One-time setup per connected org (admin):** Setup → Connected Apps OAuth
Usage → `OrbitOps CI` → **Install** → **Manage** → Edit Policies → Permitted
Users = *Admin approved users are pre-authorized* → save → add the builder's
profile (e.g. System Administrator) or a permission set. Revocable any time
from the same page.

**Repo secrets (shared, one-time):** `ORBITOPS_JWT_CLIENT_ID` (the app's
consumer key) and `ORBITOPS_JWT_KEY` (the certificate's private key — same
value as `PROD_SF_JWT_KEY`). The UI needs `SF_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `.env.local`.

> Productionization path (decision log 2026-07-15): package the connected app
> in a **managed package** installed in production — sandboxes inherit it on
> refresh, scratch orgs install it post-creation, and pre-authorization ships
> via the package's permission set: fully self-service.

### Manual: config + secrets

1. Pick an org key, e.g. `DEV_JANE` (uppercase, prefixes the secrets).
2. Authenticate to it locally, then store its credentials as **repo-level**
   secrets: for scratch orgs/sandboxes,
   `sf org display -o <alias> --verbose --json` → `result.sfdxAuthUrl` →
   secret `DEV_JANE_SF_AUTH_URL`; for persistent orgs use the JWT secret set
   (`DEV_JANE_SF_CLIENT_ID`, `_SF_USERNAME`, `_SF_JWT_KEY`, `_SF_INSTANCE_URL`).
3. Add it to `.orbitops/pipeline.yml`:
   ```yaml
   devOrgs:
     - name: "Jane's dev sandbox"
       org: DEV_JANE
       authMethod: sfdx-url
   ```
4. It appears in the UI's "Pull my changes" org picker on the next refresh.

Orgs with **source tracking** (scratch orgs, Developer/Developer Pro sandboxes)
give precise pulls — only what the builder changed. Orgs without it (Developer
Edition, larger sandboxes) still work: the retrieve falls back to a
wildcard-by-type manifest of citizen-safe metadata and the git diff filters out
everything unchanged. Tracked orgs are strongly preferred for shared orgs, where
wildcard pulls surface everyone's edits.

## 8. Roles (PoC: username lists)

The repo owner `SalikPOC` is a personal account, so GitHub teams are unavailable.
For the PoC, role mapping is by username:

- CODEOWNERS lists usernames directly (see `.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- Environment required reviewers: add users directly on the `uat`/`production`
  environments
- The UI maps roles from env vars (`ROLE_RELEASE_MANAGERS`, `ROLE_ADMINS`,
  comma-separated usernames; everyone else authenticated = citizen dev)

When moving to an org: create `citizen-devs`, `release-managers`,
`orbitops-admins` teams and switch CODEOWNERS + UI role mapping to team slugs.

## 9. Repo settings checklist

- Enable secret scanning + push protection (Settings → Code security)
- Disallow merge types other than **merge commit** (preserves Work-Items footers)
- Default branch: `main`
