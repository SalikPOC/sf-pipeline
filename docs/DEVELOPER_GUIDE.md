# OrbitOps — Pro-Code Developer Guide

The OrbitOps web UI exists for citizen developers. **You don't need it.** The
entire release process is plain Git + GitHub: branch, commit, open a PR, merge.
Everything the UI does is a convenience wrapper around the operations below —
both paths are first-class and interoperate (a change started in the UI can be
finished from the terminal, and vice versa).

## The model in one paragraph

GitHub is the source of truth, in SFDX source format (`force-app/`). Each
pipeline stage is a long-lived branch mapped to an org in
[.orbitops/pipeline.yml](../.orbitops/pipeline.yml) — order in that file is
promotion order (currently `integration` → `uat` → `main`). Every promotion is
a PR; merging it is the promotion. A merge to a stage branch triggers a
delta deploy (sfdx-git-delta) to that stage's org, gated by the stage's GitHub
Environment (required reviewers on uat/production).

## Day-to-day flow

```bash
# 1. Start from the first stage branch
git switch integration && git pull

# 2. Branch with your work item in the name (this is how traceability works)
git switch -c feature/PROJ-123-discount-field

# 3. Build. Work in your sandbox and `sf project retrieve start`, or edit
#    source directly — your call. Commit as usual.
git commit -am "Add discount field to Clinic"

# 4. Push and open the promotion PR into the first stage
git push -u origin feature/PROJ-123-discount-field
gh pr create --base integration --title "Add discount field (PROJ-123)"
```

Checks run automatically (see below). When they're green, **merge the PR —
that IS the promotion**: the deploy workflow computes the delta since the
stage's last release tag and deploys it to the stage org.

Promoting onward works the same way: open a PR from the lower stage branch to
the next one (`integration` → `uat`, `uat` → `main`). Releases to uat and
production additionally wait at the GitHub Environment gate for a release
manager's approval (Actions → the queued run → Review deployments).

## Work-item tagging (enforced by the "Work items" check)

Every promotion PR must reference a Jira issue (`PROJ-123`) or Azure DevOps
work item (`AB#456`) in **any** of:

| Where | Example |
|---|---|
| Branch name | `feature/PROJ-123-discount-field` |
| PR title | `Add discount field (PROJ-123)` |
| Commit message footer | `Work-Items: PROJ-123, AB#456` |

Commit *bodies* are not scanned — only footers, branch names, and PR titles.

## What runs on your PR

| Check | What it does | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| Resolve stage | Maps the base branch to its stage + gates via pipeline.yml | Skips everything if the base isn't a stage |
| What will deploy | sfdx-git-delta package preview, posted as a sticky PR comment | No (informational) |
| Work items | Tagging conventions above | Yes |
| Code scan | Salesforce Code Analyzer v5 on changed files; blocks on NEW findings at/above the stage's `scannerMaxSeverity` (vs the committed baseline) | Yes |
| Validate against target org | Check-only deploy (`sf project deploy validate`) against the stage org; errors posted as a sticky comment | Yes |
| Coverage gate | Apex coverage from the validation vs the stage's `minCoverage`. Not applicable (passes) when the delta contains no Apex | Yes |

A successful validation with tests produces a quick-deploy ID — the deploy on
merge reuses it when the merged tree matches, so green PRs release fast.

## Useful operations without the UI

- **Manual deploy**: Actions → "OrbitOps Deploy" → Run workflow → pick the
  stage branch, give a reason (audit-logged). The environment gate still applies.
- **Rollback**: Actions → "OrbitOps Rollback" → env + target release sequence +
  mode (`preview` first — it validates and publishes a safety report; then
  `execute`). Rollback is metadata-only, forward-revert (no force-push).
- **Release history**: git tags `deploy/<env>/<seq>`, plus JSON manifests under
  `deployments/<env>/` on the `orbitops-meta` branch (components, work items,
  actor, run URL).
- **Re-run failed checks**: GitHub's "Re-run failed jobs" on the run (the UI's
  "Try the checks again" button does exactly this).
- **Back-promotion**: after every production deploy, sync PRs (prod → uat →
  integration) open automatically so lower stages don't drift. Just review and
  merge them.

## Changing the pipeline itself

All pipeline behaviour lives on **main** — change it once, it applies everywhere:

- **Stages, orgs, gates**: `.orbitops/pipeline.yml` (PR to main; CODEOWNERS
  review). Stage order in the file is promotion order. Adding a stage also
  needs its branch, GitHub Environment, and org secrets — the UI's Settings →
  Pipeline stages automates most of that, or see SETUP.md.
- **Workflow logic**: `.github/workflows/_pr-validate.yml` and `_deploy.yml`
  are reusable workflows (the single source of truth) invoked from every stage
  branch via thin callers (`pr-validate.yml`, `deploy.yml`) that pin `@main`.
  **Never edit the callers on stage branches** — change the `_*.yml` files on
  main. Scripts live in `scripts/**` (Node ESM, unit-tested: `npm test`); jobs
  check them out from main at run time, so script fixes also land once.
- **Scanner rules/baseline**: `code-analyzer.yml` +
  `.orbitops/scanner-baseline.json` on main.

## Rules the platform enforces (don't fight them)

- No direct pushes to stage branches — merges only via PR with green checks.
- Never force-push; history (release tags, manifests) is append-only.
- Profiles are excluded via `.forceignore` — use permission sets.
- Secrets are never committed; org auth uses repo/environment secrets
  (`<ORG>_SF_AUTH_URL` or the `<ORG>_SF_*` JWT set — see SETUP.md).
